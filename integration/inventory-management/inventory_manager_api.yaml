        Use this method to update [adjustment](/docs/glossary.html#term-adjustment) reasons in your business.

        When you create adjustment reasons for your business, they are activated by default. However, if you do not want associates to
        use a specific adjustment reason to adjust inventory in the store using NewStore Fulfillment App, deactivate it using this method.

        **Note**: Deactivating an adjustment reason does not delete it from the platform.

        If associates have used the adjustment reason before you deactivated it, the reason will still be displayed in the list of inventory
        adjustments or transactions that are associated with it.

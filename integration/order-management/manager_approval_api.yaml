        Creates a rule containing the criteria that determines if an order needs approval before it can be placed
        by an associate via NewStore Associate App.

        You can use the following criteria to set approval rules:

        | Criterion name      | Type              |
        |---------------------|-------------------|
        |`has_discount`       | Boolean           |
        |`discount_value`     | Number            |
        |`discount_percentage`| Number            |
        |`discount_level`     | `order` or `item` |
        |`payment_methods`    | Array             |
        |`is_return`          | Boolean           |
        |`is_blind_return`    | Boolean           |
        |`refund_value`       | Number            |
        |`has_tax_exemption`  | Boolean           |
        |`order_value`        | Number            |

        Available values of the `payment_methods` are: `cash`, `credit_card`, `manual_credit_card`, `gift_card`, and `non_integrated`.

        **Note:** NewStore Associate App allows the associate to apply discounts either on `order` level or on
        `item` level using the `discount_level` property. If no value for `discount_level` is specified, it is set
        to `order` by default.

        You can apply a fixed discount amount to an order or item(s) using the `discount_value` property.

        If an order or item matches or exceeds the criteria specified in the approval rules, the
        order will need approval on the app.

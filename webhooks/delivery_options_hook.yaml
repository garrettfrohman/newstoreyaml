    Represents the checkout step during which shipping options are required.

    This resource contains the provider rate of an order.
    A provider rate is how NewStore identifies a shipping provider and the rates they offer.
    For example, *FedEx Overnight*, *UPS Next Day*, *DHL On-demand delivery*.

    **Note:** If youâ€™re looking to [integrate a shipping provider](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shipment)
    for booking, updating, and canceling deliveries, see
    [Shipping Provider Webhooks](/api/webhooks/delivery_hook).

    A typical use case for the shipping options webhook is to define the supported shipping providers and rates for a
    specific list of products being purchased. If an ordered product is too heavy or too large, for example, these
    webhooks allow you to offer a customer
    [customized shipping prices](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shippingoptions/#custom-shipping-price)
    that can cater to this non-standard package.

    To develop an adapter, see [shipping options](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shippingoptions).

        Requests provider rates configuration, including service level, provider name, and shipping offer price.

        **The order of the returned rates is important**: it will override any priority or existing order that you can
        have in your [fulfillment configuration](https://docs.newstore.net/developers/tutorials/fulfillment-config-new).

        **Important:** See [Retrieving custom shipping prices](/developers/guides/order-management-routing/shippingoptions/#custom-shipping-price)
        to understand how to use the ``use_as_customer_facing_cost`` flag in the
        fulfillment configuration and the price `source` in your adapter.
